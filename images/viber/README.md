These images have been extracted from screenshots I made myself of the [Viber](http://www.viber.com) instant messaging app v7.9.4 (December 2017) by Rakuten. 
I assumed a 96 by 96 pixel canvas but they would probably also fit within 92 pixels. 
Some if not all of them will be slightly offset due to the manual cropping. 

I assume they can be put here under Fair Use terms for the purpose of documentation. 
All copyrights on the graphics are held by either Rakuten or Viber Media.
