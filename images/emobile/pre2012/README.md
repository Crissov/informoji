The Japanese carrier E-Mobile announced in April 2012 that, for improved visual compattibility, their branded Android phones would be using the simple _i-mode_ design already adopted by NTT Docomo and KDDI au (EZweb). Their former design was actually quite colorful and available in large sizes. Afterwards, only Softbank and its subsidaries like Y! Mobile (formerly J-Phone) and Disney Mobile would be using a different overall design.
